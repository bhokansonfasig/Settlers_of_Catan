Small things that could be improved (not in order of importance):

1) For each player, display the number of settlements and cities that are unused for each player.
2)
3) Add dots for each number indicating the odds that number showing up, like in the game. How about making the size of the circle proportional to dots as well? That would be really informative just at a glance, or maybe it wouldn't look nice.
4) 
5) 
6) Should a gap be added between the player turn and the roll of dice to make it more realistic and not sudden?
7) When resources are allocated, adding some sort of message what resources you got would be more comprehensive.
8) During trade via ports or the bank, allow multiples of the base number. Disallow getting back a copy of the resource that was sold in port/bank trade.
9) When robber is placed on a tile, have the corresponding tile number in white overlaid on the black robber circle or something (for clarity and it rubs it in).
